***User Interface - Text***

I like when a games UI is clean, and does not cover much of the screen. Therefore I find that any text that should be displayed

on screen related to the player she be small as to not block the players view. But, the text should not be too small to where it is no longer legible. Any text relating to stats I believe is best suited in the bottom left corner, most UI elements should be located on the bottom of the screen, and therefore text should be located close to this.

Text in terms of dialogue should be as creative as possible to bring life to a game. Colour of text can differ between characters to reflect personalities, letters appearing gently compared to instantly can create a contrast to personality also. A unique sound as each letter appears can create a unique identifier for the characters voice (if no voice acting). More in terms of appearance, bubbles in which the text appears should also reflect the character speaking. I believe art design is very important when it comes to this.



***In game - Text***

To keep the game clearer and not busy with text, I think names of player characters can be displayed above in low transparent text that maybe becomes clearer and shows more information when hovered over. Enemies and less important characters (NPC's) do not need this, and can have names displayed when in dialogue.



***User Interface - Health Bar***

I think health should be displayed at the bottom middle, or top left portion of the screen, depending where other UI elements are placed. A creative health bar is always a good decision, (a heart that slowly drains, maybe a face indicator that progressively gets more sad/hurt as health drops) but in general, I think colour is very important as it allows the player to see the colour of their health in their peripherals rather than needing to directly check it and take their eyes away from the game. The common colour indicators used (and that should be used to not confuse players who play multiple games) is green for full health, yellow for mid, and red for low. Flashing red is a good indicator also





***In game - Health Bar***

In game health can be displayed on an enemy when hovering over them, maybe displaying the enemies health and name in a box, or just displaying a health bar above their head when focused on. Similar health colour properties from the users health can apply here, but also keeping the bar red no matter the health is good too, as indicators are not as important here and the solid red colour can show more of an enemy look.
